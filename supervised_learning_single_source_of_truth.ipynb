    "## Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition & Working Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on **Bayes' Theorem**, which computes the posterior probability of a class given observed features. The core assumption is that features are **conditionally independent** given the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes' Theorem (basic formula)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(C_k \\mid X) = \\frac{P(X \\mid C_k)\\,P(C_k)}{P(X)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the Naive assumption (features independent):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(X \\mid C_k) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i \\mid C_k)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihoods / Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** assumes continuous features follow a normal distribution. For each feature:\n",
    "\\[ P(x_i \\mid C_k) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_{k,i}^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x_i-\\mu_{k,i})^2}{2\\sigma_{k,i}^2}\\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** models counts (e.g., word counts) with likelihood proportional to relative frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** models binary/bag-of-words presence/absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prior**: \\(P(C_k)\\), the prevalence of class before seeing data.\n",
    "- **Likelihood**: \\(P(X\\mid C_k)\\), how probable the features are under class \\(C_k\\).\n",
    "- **Posterior**: \\(P(C_k\\mid X)\\), the updated probability after observing \\(X\\).\n",
    "- **Laplace smoothing**: add \\(\\alpha\\) to counts to avoid zero probabilities: \\(P=\\frac{count+\\alpha}{N+\\alpha|V|}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: extremely fast to train and predict, works well on high-dimensional problems (text), low memory footprint.\n",
    "- Limitations: strong independence assumption, does not model feature interactions; can be outperformed when features are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain-English Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes treats each feature as an independent witness and multiplies their evidences to find the most likely class. It's simple but often surprisingly effective, especially in text classification."
